** Lecture 5 - Indirectness in writing **

Why use indirect order in writing?
- message is bad news
- saying "no" or other disappointing news
- negative news is received more positively when an explanation precedes it
- explanation may even convince the reader that the writer's opinion is correct
- explanation cushions the shock of bad news
- not cushioning the shock makes the message harsh
- only exceptions are when bad news is routine or when the reader prefers frankness

General indirect plan
1. Begin with a strategic buffer - identify the message subject but do not indicate negative news is coming
2. Explanation - helps present your reasons in such a way that the reader will accept the news as positively as possible
3. The bad news - present the bad news as positively as you can
4. Offer an alternative - something the reader can do to help with their problem
5. End on a positive note - shift the reader's thoughts to happier things

Claims
1. Leading into the problem in the beginning - identify the transactions involved
2. Describe the problem clearly - include evidence, use courteous yet firm words
3. Requesting the correction - request what you think is fair or leave it to the reader to decide
4. Overcoming negativeness with a fair-minded close - show that you want to maintain a positive relationship

Adjustment Refusals
1. Begin with words that are on subject, are neutral about the decision, and set up your strategy
2. Present the strategy that explains/justifies, being factual and positive
3. Refuse clearly and positively, perhap include a counterproposal
4. End with off-subject, positive, forward-looking, friendly words
